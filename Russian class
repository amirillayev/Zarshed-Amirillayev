I was a first-grade student when I had my very first Russian language class. Since early childhood, 
I had a deep curiosity for languages. I had already tried learning Indian, Spanish, Chinese, French, 
and even Japanese — all on my own. But the day Russian entered my life turned out to be unforgettable.

The teacher came in, introduced herself, and gave us homework: to copy a text from the textbook. 
That was it. No proper explanation, no help. Just copy the text.
Now imagine this — I couldn’t even write my full name in Uzbek properly yet. But I tried. 
The book used block letters — like printed font — so I copied them exactly as they were. 
My writing was clumsy and not beautiful, but it was readable. I did my best.

The next lesson came. None of my classmates had done the homework — except me. I had hope. I 
thought, “Maybe I’ll be the one who gets it right. Maybe she’ll notice.”

Instead, the teacher got angry. She gave all of us a mark of “2” — the lowest grade possible 
(like an F in English grading). And yes, I got the same.

A huge red “2” in my diary.

It crushed me.

I had never received a grade lower than “5.” I had never even seen a “3” or “4.” And now — 
I skipped all of them and got the worst one. The very worst.

That day, something inside me broke. I was only seven, but I made myself a promise:

> "If I ever become a language professor, I will never learn Russian."



And I meant it. Instead, I turned to the complete opposite — English.

Now? I’ve mastered English. I can express myself, defend myself, and even challenge authority. 
I’ve been kicked out of classes and courses for speaking my mind. I’ve said things like “You are 
bullsht”* directly to teachers’ faces. Maybe that’s not ideal, but I do it for that seven-year-old
boy who couldn’t say anything back.

He cried silently over that “2,” but today, I speak for him.
