Once, humans were the weakest of all creatures.
We had no claws to tear, no fangs to kill, no wings to flee, no strength to overpower, no speed to escape. We hid in caves, praying the night would pass without a predator finding us. We were prey — fragile, helpless, forgettable.

But God gave us one gift that no other creature could claim: intelligence.
And with it, we learned. We built tools, weapons, shelters. We tamed fire. We mastered the hunt.

Centuries passed. Now, the world has changed.
The strongest predator on Earth is not the lion, the shark, or the eagle.
It is us — Homo sapiens.
We no longer live in caves. We rule cities, seas, skies, and even space.
The animals that once hunted us now hide from us.
And the ones that do not… soon face extinction.

From hunted to hunter — we are the danger now.
