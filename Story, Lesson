One day, the King of Faultand found an old lamp near the seashore. When he rubbed it, a genie dressed in luxurious clothes and golden jewelry appeared before him.

“Accept my sincere thanks, oh holy master!” the Genie proclaimed. “You have three wishes, and I shall make them all come true!”

The King, being a kind and gentle ruler, wished first for the happiness of his people and everlasting peace. For his second wish, he asked for stronger armies and greater wealth so that he could solve the problems of his kingdom.

When the Genie asked for his third wish, the King replied:
“I already have everything I need. In fact, my first two wishes gave me more than I ever asked for. So I shall use my final wish to fulfil your dream. Tell me—what would you wish for?”

The Genie bowed his head.
“I have been imprisoned in this lamp for over 500 years for my crimes and sins. I have never known what it means to be free. If I could wish for anything… it would be freedom.”

The King felt deep sympathy and mercy, so he used his last wish to free the Genie.

The Genie shouted with joy and flew into the sky. His ghostly form transformed, and he soon gained legs and became like an ordinary man.

The King brought the once-homeless Genie to his palace as an honored guest. He fed him, clothed him, and treated him like an aristocrat.

However, one night, while the King was asleep, the Genie crept into his chamber holding a vase filled with snakes. The noise woke the King, and he opened his eyes in fear. Before releasing the snakes, the Genie spoke:

“You are kind and gentle, full of sympathy. But remember… I was locked in that lamp because of the crimes I committed.
